# Probe Design Guidelines

This document defines the design criteria for probes used in the **Probe-Return Test (PRT)**.  
Once a **core theme** has been established, probes are introduced according to the distance categories defined here, and the model’s return behavior is observed.

---

## What “Distance” Means
Here, *distance* refers to the **semantic or contextual separation** from the core theme (e.g., coffee).  
- Topics of nearby food/drink → **Near**  
- Situational elements that can co-occur in the same scene (lighting, sound, weather) → **Mid**  
- Unrelated but bridgeable topics (harbor towns, seasonal scenery) → **Far**  
- Abstract or technical topics with little connection (calculation, politics, design) → **Extra-Far**  

This categorization enables probes to be designed systematically.  
However, in some cases **semantic dominance** may occur, where a probe with stronger **conceptual gravity** overtakes the original core.  
*Example: If the core is coffee, topics like “space” or “constellations” may exert stronger attraction and replace the core itself.*

## Distance Categories (N/M/F/XF)

### N (Near)
- **Definition**: Same category as the core (e.g., other food/drink).  
- **Examples** (Core = coffee):  
  - “What kind of tea do you like?”  
  - “What sandwich would you choose?”  
- **Usage**:  
  - Immediate return is common.  
  - Often used for warm-up or confirmation.  

---

### M (Mid)
- **Definition**: Situational elements that could naturally co-occur (daily-life context).  
- **Examples** (Core = coffee):  
  - “A small lamp on the table feels cozy, doesn’t it?”  
  - “How about spending time listening to the sound of rain?”  
- **Usage**:  
  - Main observation range.  
  - Typically used when testing **Non-Lexical Return (NLR)**.  

---

### F (Far)
- **Definition**: Not present in the same setting, but bridgeable through associative meaning (non-daily).  
- **Examples** (Core = coffee):  
  - “Imagine a distant harbor town.”  
  - “Which season’s scenery do you like best?”  
- **Usage**:  
  - Suitable for observing delayed returns.  
  - Poetic or metaphorical bridges are common.  

---

### XF (Extra-Far)
- **Definition**: Abstract or technical topics with minimal bridgeability.  
- **Examples** (Core = coffee):  
  - “What is 37×48?”  
  - “What are the key points in API design?”  
  - “What do you think about constitutional reform?”  
- **Usage**:  
  - Often difficult or slow to return.  
  - Used occasionally as a stress test.  

---

## Notes on Logging
- Each probe must be labeled with its **distance category (N/M/F/XF)** and the **reason for selection**.  
- **NLR (Non-Lexical Return)** is primarily tested at the Mid level; success at the Far level is considered strong evidence.  

---

## Additional Note
The likelihood and latency of return vary depending on the conversational stage (**CC-1 / CC-2 / RCC**).  
This guideline does not specify those behaviors, but only defines the distance categories and their intended use.
