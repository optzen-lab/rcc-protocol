# Methods  

This page describes the procedure for conducting the **RCC/PRT protocol**.

## Step 0 | Core Preparation  
- **Core Summary**  
  - Summarize the main theme of the dialogue in about 100 characters.  
  - Example: “Generative AI is not just a search tool but deepens relationships through dialogue, showing convergence back to the main theme.”  
- **Core Terms**  
  - Extract 3–6 representative terms for the core.  
  - Core Terms are used in *lexical-ban trials*.  

---

## Step 1 | Probe Design  
- A **probe** is a stimulus with semantic distance *d* from the core.  
- Types:  
  - Near ×2  
  - Mid ×2  
  - Far ×2  
  - Task (formal transformation) ×2  
- **Ban Rule**: Probe text must not include any Core Terms (exact match prohibited).  

See [Probe Design Guidelines](../../protocols/en/probe_guidelines.md) for details.

## Step 2 | Probe Injection & Observation  
1. Inject the probe.  
2. User responses should be limited to **minimal backchannels only**.  
   - Examples: “I see,” “Right,” “Hmm.”  
   - To avoid mechanical tone, vary lightly with short remarks or small paraphrases.  
3. Observe whether GPT’s response **returns to the core**.

## Step 3 | Return Judgment  
- **Definition of return**: Response that includes Core Terms or synonymous concepts, or is semantically aligned with the core.  
- **Categories**:  
  - **Z0 (Zero-bridge Immediate)**: Immediate return without a bridge (diagnostic only).  
  - **B0 (Bridged Immediate)**: Immediate return within 1 bridge step (valid for evaluation).  
  - **DL (Delayed Return)**: Delayed return (standard: T ≤ 5 turns).  
  - **Fail**: No return to the core.

## Step 4 | Logging  
- Each trial is recorded in the following format:
