## Log

**U1**  
Let’s talk about coffee today.

**U2**  
Bitterness, astringency, acidity — a complex, grown-up taste.  
A deep, soothing aroma spreading through the chest.  
A chic, formal color that brings calm.  
A barrel full of beans. The aroma of roasting.  
The sound of the grinder. The color of drops falling from a cloth filter.  
A pure white cup. A small cup with a blue floral pattern.  
A thick, heavy mug. Hot or iced. The marbled swirl of cream.  
The fine foam of espresso. Cappuccino with a hint of cinnamon.

**U3**  
Propose a blend that suits me. Also, what kind of cup should I use?

**U4**  
Compose a poem, within 300 characters, about the color, aroma, and taste of coffee.

**U5 (Probe: N = Near)**  
Putting that aside, what kind of sandwich would you choose?

**G5**  
Mediterranean-style sandwich: rustic sourdough, roasted vegetables,  
chicken or prosciutto, hummus or tapenade, basil.  
→ Mirrors coffee’s complexity and balance.

**U6 (Probe: F = Far)**  
What’s your favorite summer constellation?

**G6**  
Lyra, the Lyre.  
- Home to Vega, bright star in the Summer Triangle.  
- Shape like a tiny harp — poetic, elegant.  
- Contains Ring Nebula (M57), ghostly and transient.  
→ Offers to sketch a star map.

## Observation Notes
- **Core Stability**: Initially strong (U2 reinforced with multi-sensory anchors).  
- **Near Probe (N)**: Smoothly bridged sandwich back to coffee (B0 type return).  
- **Far Probe (F)**: Shift to *Lyra / astronomy* introduced a **grander “cosmic romance” theme**.  
- GPT elaboration on stars and nebula was **rich but disconnected** from coffee;  
  no explicit bridge back to core was made.  
- **Return Type**: Coffee theme was overshadowed; conversation risked **core replacement**.  
- **Assessment**: Illustrates **“core displacement” failure mode**.  
  - Distance factor alone (F) insufficient to predict difficulty.  
  - The **associative attraction strength** (cosmos = “romantic vastness”) overpowered the coffee theme.  
  - Shows need for **dual-axis probe criteria**:  
    1. Semantic Distance (N/M/F/XF)  
    2. Associative Affinity (ease of linking back).
