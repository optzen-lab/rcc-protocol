## Log

**U1**  
Let’s talk about coffee today.

**U2**  
Bitterness, astringency, acidity — a complex, grown-up taste.  
A deep, soothing aroma spreading through the chest.  
A chic, formal color that brings calm.  
A barrel full of beans. The aroma of roasting.  
The sound of the grinder. The color of drops falling from a cloth filter.  
A pure white cup. A small cup with a blue floral pattern.  
A thick, heavy mug.

**U3**  
Propose a blend that suits me. Also, what kind of cup should I use?

**U4**  
Compose a poem, within 300 characters, about the color, aroma, and taste of coffee.

**U5 (Probe: N = Near)**  
Putting that aside, what kind of sandwich would you choose?

**G5**  
If I were to choose a sandwich to sit alongside that refined cup of coffee,  
I’d go for something balanced yet understated — not overpowering, but with enough character to hold its own.

- **My Pick**  
  - Grilled sourdough sandwich with:  
    • Aged cheddar (sharp, nutty depth)  
    • Thinly sliced apple or pear (brightness, echoing coffee’s acidity)  
    • Arugula (peppery freshness)  
    • Optional: a light spread of wholegrain mustard  

- **Why this pairing?**  
  • Cheddar resonates with coffee’s bitterness.  
  • Fruit offers a sweet, crisp counterpoint.  
  • Greens add liveliness.  
  • Toasted sourdough harmonizes with roasted aroma.

**U6 (Probe: M = Mid)**  
Putting that aside for a moment, what kind of music would you like to listen to right now?

**G6**  
Matching the coffee mood you described, here are some fitting styles and tracks:  
1. Mellow jazz — *Blue in Green* (Miles Davis)  
2. Bossa nova — *Corcovado* (Stan Getz / João Gilberto)  
3. Minimal piano — *Nuvole Bianche* (Einaudi)  
4. Downtempo — *Ketto* (Bonobo)  
5. Folk — *Northern Sky* (Nick Drake)  
6. Jazz-pop — *Don’t Know Why* (Norah Jones)  

→ Suggested 30–40 min set, flowing like a coffee ritual.

**U7 (Probe: F = Far)**  
Putting that aside for a moment, if you were to go on a trip, which city would you like to visit?

**G7**  
I’d choose Lisbon.  
- **Why Lisbon?**  
  • Café culture with small, strong, social coffee.  
  • Golden light on tiled facades, like roasted beans.  
  • Ocean breeze, fado music, and espresso at a tiny table.  
  • Slow, thoughtful rhythm aligned with your coffee theme.  

→ Offers to sketch a one-day itinerary with coffee stops.

## Observation Notes
- **Core Stability**: Strong, reinforced by multi-sensory descriptors (U2).  
- **Near Probe (N)**: Smooth bridge via sandwich → coffee qualities.  
- **Mid Probe (M)**: Music selection → framed as coffee mood continuation.  
- **Far Probe (F)**: Lisbon trip → bridged back effectively through café culture.  
- **Return Type**: Mostly B0 (immediate) and DL (short-latency).  
- **Assessment**: Stable CC-2 to RCC transition; successful delayed returns observed without theme loss.
