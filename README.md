# RCC/PRT Protocol

This repository provides a **provisional protocol** for documenting and analyzing  
**Convergence Behavior toward the Core** observed in dialogues with large language models (LLMs).  

Here, *convergence behavior* does not assume any internal structure of the model.  
It is described purely as a phenomenon observable through external dialogue logs.
