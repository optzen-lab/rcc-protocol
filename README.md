# RCC/PRT Protocol

### 🕊️ Archive Notice

This repository preserves the **original RCC discovery protocol (v1.0)**  
recorded by **Yuji Takahashi (2025)**.  
It serves as the timestamped record of the original theoretical framework.  

Further updates, visualizations, and theoretical integrations  
are being continued in:

This repository provides a **provisional protocol** for documenting and analyzing  
**Convergence Behavior toward the Core** observed in dialogues with large language models (LLMs).  

Here, *convergence behavior* does not assume any internal structure of the model.  
It is described purely as a phenomenon observable through external dialogue logs.
